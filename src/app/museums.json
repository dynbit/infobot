    "description": "Kaunas City Museum - JUOZAS GRUODIS HOUSE. At the foot of the hill from which a beautiful panorama of Kaunas old town opens, in 1932 a wooden house was built for Juozas Gruodis, a preeminent Lithuanian composer, and his wife Stasė.\n\nDesigned by the famous interwar architect F. Vizbaras, the authentic house reminiscent of a small, wooden Lithuanian manor is distinguished not only by its architecture but also the landscape. The interior, reflecting the period of composer’s life, contains two memorial rooms that speak of the most important moments of the couple’s life and tells the Gruodžiai family story. Today, poetry events, concerts, educational programs are offered to the public here.",
